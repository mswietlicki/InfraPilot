# Deployment Ingest API

Endpoint for CI/CD pipelines to report deployment events to InfraPilot.

```
POST /api/deployments/events
```

## Authentication

Every request must include an API key header:

```
X-Api-Key: <your-api-key>
```

Keys are provisioned by an admin and may be scoped to specific products. A scoped key can only ingest events for the products it was created for; attempts to post for other products return `403 Forbidden`.

Rate limiting is applied per key.

## Field reference

### Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `product` | string | **yes** | — | Product name. Must be non-empty. |
| `service` | string | **yes** | — | Service or component within the product. |
| `environment` | string | **yes** | — | Target environment (e.g. `development`, `staging`, `production`). |
| `version` | string | **yes** | — | Version identifier. Any format is accepted (semver, git SHA, build tag). |
| `source` | string | **yes** | — | Identifies the CI/CD system sending the event. |
| `deployedAt` | DateTimeOffset | **yes** | — | UTC timestamp of the deployment. Must not be the zero value. |
| `status` | string | no | `"succeeded"` | One of: `succeeded`, `failed`, `in_progress`. Case-insensitive. |
| `isRollback` | boolean | no | `false` | Whether this deployment is a rollback to a previous version. |
| `previousVersion` | string | no | _server-derived_ | The predecessor version the caller observed. When omitted, the server derives it from the most recent event for the same product/service/environment. Supplying this lets integrators assert the predecessor they saw and detect drift vs. the server's history. |
| `references` | array | no | `[]` | Links to external resources (repos, pipelines, PRs, tickets). |
| `participants` | array | no | `[]` | People involved in the deployment. |
| `metadata` | object | no | `{}` | Free-form key-value pairs for custom data. |

### `status` values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `succeeded` | Deployment completed successfully. Only this status creates promotion candidates and is eligible as a rollback target. |
| `failed` | Deployment failed. Recorded for tracking and dashboards. |
| `in_progress` | Deployment is still running. Can be updated later by sending a new event with the same version and a final status. |

### `references[]` object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | **yes** | Reference category. |
| `url` | string | no | Full URL to the external resource. |
| `provider` | string | no | Provider name (e.g. `github`, `azure-devops`, `gitlab`, `jira`). |
| `key` | string | no | Unique identifier in that system (commit SHA, PR number, ticket key). |
| `revision` | string | no | Git revision / commit SHA. Can be omitted if not available. |
| `title` | string | no | Human-readable title (e.g. work-item summary, PR title). When supplied for a `work-item` reference, the server uses it directly and skips the Jira lookup. |
| `participants` | array | no | Reference-scoped participants. Same shape as the top-level `participants[]` (see below) — a PR has its author/reviewer, a ticket has its QA/assignee, a commit has its author. Optional and may be omitted entirely on legacy senders. |

#### `references[].participants[]` — reference-scoped participants

A reference may carry its own `participants[]` array. Same shape as the event-level participants block — `role` is required, `displayName` and `email` are optional — but scoped to the specific PR/ticket/commit instead of the deploy as a whole. This is the natural place to put a ticket's QA, a PR's reviewer, or a commit's author.

```jsonc
"references": [
  {
    "type": "work-item",
    "provider": "jira",
    "key": "PLT-1234",
    "title": "Add idempotency key to checkout endpoint",
    "participants": [
      { "role": "qa",       "displayName": "Eve QA",     "email": "eve.qa@acmetrix.com" },
      { "role": "assignee", "displayName": "Dan Dev",    "email": "dan.dev@acmetrix.com" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "type": "pull-request",
    "provider": "github",
    "key": "312",
    "participants": [
      { "role": "author",   "displayName": "Jan Kowalski", "email": "jan@acmetrix.com" },
      { "role": "reviewer", "displayName": "Anna Kowalska", "email": "anna@acmetrix.com" }
    ]
  }
]
```

The event-level `participants[]` block is still accepted and is the right place for genuinely event-level roles like `triggered-by` (the deployer / pipeline trigger). When both layers are present and both carry a participant for the same role, **reference-level wins** for read-time lookups — a participant attached directly to a PR/ticket is a more specific signal than the event-level fallback.

The excluded-role rule (`excludeRole` on a promotion policy) checks both layers: the user is blocked from approving if they appear with the excluded role at *either* level.

Common `type` values:

| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `repository` | Link to the source code repository. |
| `pipeline` | Link to the CI/CD build or workflow run. |
| `pull-request` | Link to the merged PR that triggered the deploy. |
| `work-item` | Link to a Jira ticket, Azure DevOps work item, etc. |

**Commit deep-linking.** When a `repository` reference includes both `url` and `revision`, the UI renders a link to the specific commit, derived from `provider`:

| Provider | Resolved URL |
|---|---|
| `github`, `azure-devops` | `{url}/commit/{revision}` |
| `gitlab` | `{url}/-/commit/{revision}` |
| `bitbucket` | `{url}/commits/{revision}` |
| _other / omitted_ | falls back to `url` |

The URL is derived purely from the inbound `url` (with any trailing `.git` or `/` stripped) — no org/repo names are hardcoded.

### `participants[]` object

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `role` | string | **yes** | Role in the deployment process. |
| `displayName` | string | no | Human-readable name. |
| `email` | string | no | Email address. Used for identifying the pipeline trigger in the promotions system. |

`role` is a free-form string — the platform doesn't enforce a fixed taxonomy, so senders can add new roles without schema changes. Canonical roles recognized by the platform:

| Role | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `triggered-by` | **Canonical.** Person or service principal that initiated the pipeline run. Used by the promotions system to populate `sourceDeployerEmail` and to enforce the "exclude deployer" approval rule (same person can't approve their own promotion). |
| `author` | Git commit author on the deployed revision. |
| `reviewer` | Person who reviewed/approved the PR. |
| `qa` | QA engineer who validated the change. |

Senders can emit additional custom roles (e.g. `release-manager`, `on-call`) — they'll surface in the UI as-is alongside the canonical ones.

### Canonicalisation on write

By default the platform canonicalises role and environment strings to **kebab-case** on write, so `"Triggered By"`, `"triggeredBy"`, `"triggered_by"`, and `"TRIGGERED-BY"` all become `triggered-by`; `"Production"` becomes `production`. Controlled in `appsettings.json`:

```json
"Normalization": {
  "Roles": "kebab-case",
  "Environments": "kebab-case"
}
```

Set either field to `null` to preserve sender casing exactly as sent. Read-time matching (e.g. the `triggered-by` lookup for the "exclude deployer" rule) always normalises before comparing, so the feature works regardless of the policy.

## Response

### 201 Created

```json
{
  "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
  "version": "2.14.0-rc.3",
  "previousVersion": "2.13.1"
}
```

`previousVersion` is the most recent prior version deployed to the same product/service/environment, or `null` for first-time deployments.

### 400 Bad Request

```json
{
  "errors": [
    "'product' is required",
    "'status' must be one of: succeeded, failed, in_progress"
  ]
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

Returned when the API key is scoped to specific products and the `product` in the payload is not in the allowed list.

      "email": "tomasz.wojcik@acmetrix.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Two-level participants (reference-scoped)

Same deployment as the GitHub Actions example, but with the QA tagged on the ticket and the reviewer tagged on the PR — instead of mixed in to the top-level `participants[]`. The deployer (`triggered-by`) stays at event level because it's not scoped to any one reference.

```json
{
  "product": "ticketing-platform",
  "service": "order-api",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "2.14.0",
  "source": "github-actions",
  "deployedAt": "2026-04-16T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "references": [
    {
      "type": "pull-request",
      "url": "https://github.com/Acmetrix/order-api/pull/312",
      "provider": "github",
      "key": "312",
      "participants": [
        { "role": "author",   "displayName": "Jan Kowalski",  "email": "jan@acmetrix.com" },
        { "role": "reviewer", "displayName": "Anna Kowalska", "email": "anna@acmetrix.com" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "work-item",
      "url": "https://acmetrix.atlassian.net/browse/PLT-1234",
      "provider": "jira",
      "key": "PLT-1234",
      "title": "Add idempotency key to checkout endpoint",
      "participants": [
        { "role": "qa",       "displayName": "Piotr Nowak",    "email": "piotr@acmetrix.com" },
        { "role": "assignee", "displayName": "Marta Wisniewska", "email": "marta@acmetrix.com" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "participants": [
    { "role": "triggered-by", "displayName": "Pipeline Bot", "email": "ci@acmetrix.com" }
  ]
}
```

### Rollback

```json
{
  "product": "marketplace",
  "service": "payment-gateway",
  "environment": "production",
  "version": "4.2.1",
  "source": "github-actions",
  "deployedAt": "2026-04-16T11:45:00Z",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "isRollback": true,
  "metadata": {
    "rollbackReason": "Elevated error rate after 4.3.0 deploy",
    "rollbackFrom": "4.3.0"
  }
}
```

## Promotion integration

When a `succeeded` deployment event is ingested, the system automatically checks for matching promotion topology edges. If the deployment's environment is a source in the promotion graph (e.g. `development` or `staging`), a **promotion candidate** is created for the next environment in the chain.

The `triggered-by` participant is used as the deployer identity for the "exclude deployer" approval rule, which prevents the person who triggered the deploy from also approving the promotion to the next environment.

## cURL example

```bash
curl -X POST https://infrapilot.example.com/api/deployments/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-api-key-here" \
  -d '{
    "product": "marketplace",
    "service": "search-api",
    "environment": "staging",
    "version": "1.0.42",
    "source": "github-actions",
    "deployedAt": "2026-04-16T14:00:00Z"
  }'
```
